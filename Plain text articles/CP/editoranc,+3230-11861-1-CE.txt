Resumen
José Rizal es un autor canónico
en la Filipinas,
donde se le considera
el perfecto
ejemplo de luchador
anticolonial.
La presencia
de los Estados Unidos en la isla
transformó
el paisaje lingüístico
del país, cuyos ciudadanos
tan solo pueden ac-
ceder'
la obra de su escritor nacional a través de traducciones
del castellano
al
inglés. El estudio de dos de esas traducciones
(Derbyshire
1912 y Guerrero
1968)
permite profundizar
en cuestiones
ideológicas,
culturales
y lingüísticas
que ayu-
dan a entender
el papel del colonialismo
estadounidense
en las Filipinas.
La
traducción
se convierte así en un mapa que, con la ayuda de la teoría postcolonial,
permite crear estrategias
de resistencia

José Rizal (Calamba,
1861 - Manila, 1896) is a problematic
figure full
of contradictions,
misunderstood
in his own time and misread afterwards.
Although Philippine critics consider him a canonical author, he wrote in
a 1anguage that many of his compatriots could not read. Seen as the fa-
ther ofPhilippine
nationalism, he hadjoined
the Spaniards on their way
to Cuba to fight an anti-Spanish rebellion when he was sent back to Ma-
nila to be judged, and, later, the Spaniards, for promoting a rebellion he
did not support, sentenced him to death. Somehow, it seems impossible
to grasp the complexity ofthis figure, and it is not my intention to do so,
but his presence is a reminder ofthe limitations faced by theorists when
trying to explain the colonial encounter and the post-colonial
world. In a

field where European languages, Asian languages, languages in transla-
tion, translation theory, and postcolonial
studies converge, Rizal's pres-
ence, rather, the presence of his ghost, may help us understand sorne of
the problems that we face when trying to explain the colonial experience
and its impact on the contemporary world.
One ofthe main problems scholars find when dealing with texts
in translation outside the boundaries of a strictly linguistic approach is
the need to build bridges, to find plausible explanations
for phenomena
that cannot be fully explained either from a linguistic point of view or
from a cultural one. Postcolonial translation studies emerged sorne fifteen
years ago (Robinson
3) as a new field of scholarship
that opened the
boundaries
of traditional
approaches
to translation,
mainly
using
postcolonial
theory. While talking about a completely different matter,
Keith Harvey summarises the position ofthese new translation theories,
in need of solutions that cannot be found in any specific discipline:
Translation
is not just about texts: nor is it only about cultures and
power. It is about the relation of the one to the other. [...) What is
required,
then, in translation
studies is a methodology
that neither
prioritises
broad concems
with power, ideology and patronage
to
the detriment
of the need to examine
representative
examples
of
text, nor contents
itselfwith
detailed text-linguistic
analysis while
making
do with sketch y and generalised
notions
of contexl.
[...)
The challenge
is to find a way just not to situate
discourse
in its
interactional
and cultural
settings,
but to give the relationship
between settings and discourse
the force of causality
(447).
This concern,
i.e. to build bridges
between
traditional
text-based
approaches to translation and modem and postmodem
cultural readings
of translation,
is at the base of this paper. 1 will discuss two different
English translations of José Rizal's novel, Noli me tangere, in an attempt
to collapse assumptions about language and translation that do not seem
to be valid any longer.
Linguistic
Approaches
and Cultural Reflections
Traditionallinguistic
approaches to translation, based for a long
time upon a misread quote from Horace (Robinson
51), worked on a
merely linguistic base, trying to avoid verbum pro verbo renderings and
moving towards a sensum pro senso work; hence the need to find new
translation
units beyond isolated words. First, sentences;
afterwards,

complete paragraphs,
and, lately, entire cultures have been considered
translation units, acceptable frarnes in which to fit the practice oftransla-
tion. Ideal profiles of the translator were construed according to these
units, bilingual people with knowledge ofthe two languages involved or,
even better, bicultural
people, capable of moving freely between cul-
tures, inhabitants of that in-between space evoked by 8habha (216).
From the very beginning ofthe discipline, postcolonial studies
scholars have used translation mainly as a metaphor, a symptom to des-
cribe the colonial illness present in the relationship between the coloniser
and the colonised: translation
has been seen either as a colonising tool
(Cheyfitz) or as a device for resistance (Rafael), always inscribed in a
major cultural frame, that of colonialismo Actuallanguage
and translations
were at the heart ofthe colonising experience, because Europeans had to
communicate
somehow to peoples overseas their new fate under white
rule and sorne linguistic
mediation
was needed.
Thus,
colonised
individuals were forced to leam European languages in order to serve as
interpreters.
Likewise, missionaries
leamed Indigenous
languages and
translated their religious texts to preach and to convert the colonised
peoples, while European languages displaced local tongues as languages
of power and culture.
The approach of postcolonial
studies to translation,
however,
has very rarely taken into account the research made in the field oftrans-
lation studies. Scholars saw it as too linguistically
oriented and, there-
fore, not suited to explain relationships that were far beyond the scope of
mere words or texts. Something similar happened the other way round:
translation
studies scholars have been very resistant to accepting new
research made in the field ofpostcolonial
studies, viewing it as too meta-
phorical and without the attachment
to actual discourse
that is at the
heart of any linguistic discipline.
That said, it must be remembered that translation and metaphor
are indeed connected, if only etymologically, since both terms indicate a
sense of movement, inherent to the activity oftravelling
from on language
to another. Besides this etymological
connection,
though, there is the
fact that translation
has traditionally
been described
using metaphors,
usually related to sexual images: the quest for fidelity and the idea ofthe
translator penetrating
in the source-language
text are common in many
translation theories I.

Neither
the traditional
linguistic
approaches
nor the more
modem postcolonial
readings of translation seem to be able to escape
the tyranny of metaphors, and, in their search for the ultimate image to
explain the phenomena observed, none ofthem
could fully account for
the translation practices ofthe postrnodem era, the era of globalisation.
In their assumptions of separate languages, separate cultures, that have
to meet somewhere in the middle, either in a domesticosetting, closer to
the target language, or in a foreign ground, closer to the source language-,
many of these theoretical
constructs fail to explain current translation
practices, often more complex than the conventional relationship between
the self and the other.
Rizal in English
José Rizal has been seen as the nationalist Philippine writer par
excellence. However, his literary production (the novels Noli me tangere
and E/filibusterismo)
poses many problems, among which the fact that it
was composed in Spanish, a language that is no longer widely spoken in
his country, after many years ofNorth-American
colonisation and cultural
influence.
Many translations have been done ofRizal's
novels. Sorne have
acquired canonical status within the Philippines,
to the point of being
compulsory readings in the Philippine
educational
system, and others
remain less known or have been completely
forgotten.
It is not my
intention to present a comparison
of them all or to engage in a close
reading ofthe original and the translations. Sorne ofthis work has already
been done (Anderson 235-262) and my purpose is quite different: I would
like to present Rizal 's translations as a problem, because they are occupy
a quite particular space and ask more questions than they are able to
solve.
Edition
André Lefevere has done extensive research on the conditions
under which a translation is published, who publishes it, when, why, etc.
and has come up with the concept of"patronage."
The same way it did
during the Early Modem period, money matters today, and, therefore,
literary productions (translations for instance) are shaped by forces beyond
the literary field, by people with a lot more than merely cultural capital.

It is important, then, to take into account the conditions under which the
different editions were published.
1have worked with three different editions ofRizal's
text, each
one representing a different stage in the history ofthe Philippines and its
relationship with Rizal. These editions are:

The Lost Eden. A Completely
New Translationfor
the Contemporary
Reader
by León María Guerrero with His Introduction.
Greenwood
Press:
New York, 1968.
The original version with which I have worked was published in Barcelona
in 1998, a quite significant date, since it marked the centennial of the
"disaster",
the loss of the last remains of the Spanish colonies, Cuba,
Pue
o Rico and the Philippines
(although everybody seemed to forget
that in 1898 parts of Morocco and Equatorial
Guinea were still under
Spanish rule ...). Much attention was devoted to the impact ofthat fact on
fin de siécle Spanish life and culture, but less to its significance for the
former colonies. In an attempt to "recuperar
esa mirada de ultramar y
conmemorar
el centenario
de aquella fecha" the editors published
a
collection ofthree
texts: Rizal's Noli me tangere, José Martí's Diarios
and Alejandro Tapia y Ribera's Póstumo el transmigrado.
Derbyshire's
translation was first published in Manila in 1912
when the Philippines were a US colony, sorne fourteen years after they
had been "freed
from the Spanish
domination
by the United
States
intervention"
(Rizal, Eden vi). It underwent more than ten re-editions
and it was used for educational purposes, since the Philippine Education
Company published it. Guerreros
was the last to be published, in 1968,
and its historical coordinates
were quite different: the Philippines
had
become
an independent
state,
but US imperialism
and Japanese
occupation during World War 11had definitely shaped the country and
its people.
Anderson reminds us that it is impossible to read the Noli me
tangere today as a young Manileño would have read it in 1897 (Anderson
232). We have, then, three different settings and three potential readers,
quite different from the "amigo o enemigo" (Rizal, Noli 40) Rizal may

have imagined when composing his work. For the Spanish edition, XX
th
century Spaniards, who no longer dominate the country; for Derbyshire's
translation,
1920s Philippine readers under US rule; and for Guerrero's
version, contemporary Philippines, who seem to be quite similar to their
North-American
counterparts,
if one takes into account the image that
this translation
projects of its readers. Rizal wrote for a very specific
audience, Spanish colonisers and fellow XIX
th century Philippines,
an
audience that no longer exists, and this historical burden affects the way
we may read today both the original or the translations'.
TitIe and lernrna
1will be discussing several features ofthese texts, including an
analysis of sorne parts ofthe novel, but 1want to start with the peripher-
ies of them, those parts that frame the text and situate it in a given con-
text: title, lernma, and dedication; the metatext.
The Latin original title, Noli me tangere, is a very significant
quote from Saint John's
Gospel,
the first words Jesus said to Mary
Magdalene after his resurrection.
It was an indication of the influence
that the religion he was to criticise so fiercely in his book had had on
Rizal. Many aspects of Rizal's life and thought were not understood
in
his time -he
had problems,
among other things, because of his antí-
clericalism-
and this makes him a complicated figure who is difficult to
describe.
However,
compJicated
figures
are not useful for political
purposes and need to be simplified, their words must be reinterpreted
to
fit the image one has ofthem:
thus, when shot by the Spaniards, he was
dismissed
as a "rebelde".
No questions
asked.
Quite
the
same
simplification
goes on when translators use different quotes of Rizal to
title their versions. Did Derbyshire see "the social cancer" as a way of
describing the state of the Philippines
under Spanish colonialism,
and,
therefore, as a way ofmaking the US rule seem an improvement? Why is
Guerrero misquoting
from Rizal's
last poem" if not to go back to an
irnagined-golden era, before US colonisation?
Ifthe translation ofthe title is used to simplify Rizal and to push
him back into History, the presence or absence oflernmata can be read as
an attempt to reframe his work, to avoid the questions his novel asked.
The original was preceded by a quote from a poem by Schiller translated
into Spanish, probably by Rizal himself:

«¿Qué? ¿No podría un César presentarse

[Quia! Si no vemos más que concejales,

«Mas, di, ¿qué pueden estos perdularios
hacer de grande?
¿Pueden tales ratas dar lugar a hechos extraordinarios?»
(Rizal, Noli 35)
»Was? Es dürfte kein Casar auf euren Bühnen sioh zeigen,
Kein Achill, kein Orest, keine Andromacha

-Nichts! Man sieht bei uns nur Pfarrer, Comrnerzienrathe,
Fahndriche,
Secretars
oder Husarenmajors.
»Aber, ich bitte dich, Freund, was kann den n dieser Misere
Groñes begegnen,
was kann GroBes den n durch sie geschehn?«
(Schiller)
This poem, Shakespeares
Schatten. Eine Parodie, illustrates the fierce
irony of the relationship
between the artist and the social powers, and
thus makes a perfect lernma. Framing the novel, it is a very good surnmary
of Rizal's
critique,
since it indicates
his purpose
of criticising
petty
officials and elerics who impeded the development ofhis country. It also
makes him part of a tradition, shows how he was using tools that had
already been used elsewhere,
and, at the same time, demonstrates
his
originality in applying them to a completely new setting -the
Philippines.
When Derbyshire erases it, he is erasing all inter-textuality;
no dialog is
possible and Rizal remains a "rebelde", but one without a cause.
Guerrero's
case is even more problematic,
because he not only
erases the quote, but ineludes a quite different one: Rizal's last poem,
written short before he was executed, which he titles "The lost Eden". As
1have indicated before, it is quite a different thing to talk about "último
pensamiento"
than to say "the lost Eden", not only because Rizal never
actually used the word "lost" but because, in doing so, Guerrero is pushing
Rizal aside,
making
a romantic
figure
out of him, and, therefore,
disempowering him. lrony of ironies, the version of the poem is supposed
to be Derbyshire's.
Rizal's original showed his erudition and inscribed him in the
European literary tradition. This inscription has undergone a process of
eros ion and denial, which ultimately led to what Anderson calls the "de-
europeanisation" (244) ofRizal: the text becomes fossilised and is pushed
back to space outside oftime,
a process that can be seen in the changes

Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada
made to titles, lernmata and dedications. This systematic erasure cannot
be explained from a linguistic point ofview since all the terms involved
have cornmon equivalents in English; therefore, the explanation must lie
somewhere else: this manipulation
actually shows the ideology of the
translators and calls for a whole re-evaluation
of their role as linguistic
mediators.
Dedication
Rizal was a doctor; therefore,
it is not surprising that he used
medical metaphors
in his writing. When addressing his fatherland, he
evokes a cancer that must be treated in order for it to recover its health;
that is exactly the purpose ofhis work, to show the problems and to wait
for people to propose a cure. Even if it is never clear what this cancer
could be, it is not difficult either to imagine that Rizal is talking about the
Spanish rule in the Philippines or that he is advocating for the condition
of his country to be improved, in a comparison move which is a typical
example of what Anderson has called "double consciousness"
(229).
This medical
metaphor,
however,
suffers such a process
of
amplification in the translations that it becomes a hyperbole. The reader
is oriented in a way never intended by Rizal, making the author appear as
the rebel he never was. Derbyshire exploits the usage of typographical
resources while Guerrero c1early exaggerates the extent of the medical
metaphor:
A mi patria.

Historical
Specificity:
Mediators
and their Time
Peter Newmark has a word of advice for translators on notes,
additions and glosses, which is very clear in its purpose: "The artistic
illusion of your non-existence
is unnecessary"
(93). The fallacy of the
invisibility ofthe translator has been going on for a long time and is still
re-enacted when texts are read in translation as ifthey were originals, a
question that has been highlighted
by many theorists and which poses
many problems to the research being conducted in several disciplines,
mainly in the field ofComparative
Literature.'
This
being
said,
both
Derbyshire
and Guerrero
follow
Newmark's advice and make their presence clear, either introducing notes
to the text or a foreword
commenting
on their
translation.
Their
proc dures, however, are quite different. Nevertheless,
before getting to
the presence of'the translators in their work, we must pay attention to the
absence ofthe author frorn his own work, a problem that is often forgotten
when explaining these kinds of linguistic transfers.
The road that goes from the author's manuscript to the actual
printed volume can be a long one and is mediated by the figure of the
editor. This figure has been traditionally dismissed in translation theory
since
her
intervention
is previous
to the
semasiological
and
onomasiological
processes
involved in translation;
but editorship
is a
linguistic mediation as well, since it implies a process of interpretation
that can be compared to that implemented within translation, except that
it only involves one language. This consideration
is quite important in
this case, since the 1998 edition with which 1 have been working leads
the reader in very specific ways, offering explanations
that seem to be
absent from the original edition, and erasing the author's notes that were
there and that subsequently
resurface only in translation.
The editors have included a great number of footnotes that can
only be explained bearing in mind potential readers ofthe edition: XX
th
century Spaniards, who appear to be seen as quite uneducated,
1 must
sayo Sorne deal with geographical
sites such as "Binondo"
("arrabal

Manila, fuera de la ciudad murada, conocido por su activo comercio"
[Rizal, Noli 39]) or "Makiling"
("monte que separa las provincias
de

Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada
Laguna
y Tayabas"
[Rizal,
Noli
198); others
give encyclopaedic
information
about different
terrns, perfectly
understandable
for the
comrnon reader ("paulistas", "religiosos pertenecientes a la congregación
fundada en 1625 por San Vicente de Paúl" [Rizal, Noli 79]); sorne translate
foreign quotes and terms that appeared untranslated in the original, such
as Latin sentences ("beati pauperes spiritu", "bienaventurados
los pobres
de espíritu" [Rizal, Noli 78]) or Tagalog words ("dalaga", "palabra tagala
que significa mujer soltera, doncella"
[Rizal, Noli 41]); but the most
interesting are those in which the text is interpreted in order to expose
what was supposed
to be Rizal's thinking or to make it closer to an
autobiography.
For instance, when describing
Capitán Tiago's
house,
Rizal says that the fumishings are "incómodos y malsanos", but the editor
seems compelled to add on a footnote that "Rizal consideraba impropias
para países tropicales las sillas de cojín y forradas de terciopelo que se
usaban en Europa."(Rizal,
Noli 42). Another
instance
would be the
description
of the separation
between
María
Clara and her fiancé
Crisóstomo Ibarra, when he left the Philippines for Spain and she entered
a convent to pursue her education "bajo la vigilancia de la madre escucha",
a nun who, the editor explains, "en los conventos y colegios de niñas,
tiene por oficio acompañar a las que reciben visitas y vigilarlas."
To this
semantic information,
a biographical
entry is added: "Esta parte de la
narración
supone un reflejo
de la vida de Rizal.
Rizal partió
para
Barcelona el día 3 de mayo de 1882, dejando a la novia en Manila, una
hermosa joven llamada Leonor Rivera." (Rizal, Noli 82).
As we have seen, the translator
is not the only one who can
become invisible; the author as well can be silenced or interpreted,
not
being allowed to speak by himself. The paradox
is that Derbyshire's
translation
actually gives Rizal his own voice back, making a clear
distinction between author 's notes and translator's notes, which are usually
cultural or geographical
but never interfere with the original quotes in
languages other than Spanish. Sorne examples; for instance, the gloss on
"the sons of Guzman" (the Dominican friars, whose order was founded
by Dominic de Guzmán)", or the "Sabana Drive" (now Plaza Lawton
and Bagumbayan)". Rizal is not interpreted as flagrantly as he is in the
Spanish edition, but his geography
is adapted to fit historie evolution,
the American presence in the archipelago.
This move, which respects
Rizal's text and inscription between a European and a Tagalog literary
98

tradition but americanises
his geographical
descriptions
is very reveal-
ing as far as Derbyshire's
intentions are concemed.
More interesting, however, is the level oftranslator's
presence
and manipulation in Guerrero's translation. 1would like to show how his
actual work contradicts
his own statements,
and the way in which his
foreword to the translation
collapses traditional
assumptions
that have
been the base oftranslation
or postcolonial
studies.
A much-quoted
letter written in 1857 by Edward Fitzgerald,
translator of Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyán, is usually given as an example
of the colonial
approach
to translation.
During the colonial
era, the
coloniser felt entitled to play freely with the text, since non-European
texts were not good enough and, therefore, needed a European hand to
intervene in order to make thern more "literary"; something that Fitzgerald
seemed very happy to do:
It is an amusement
for me to take what liberties
[ like with these
Persians,
who (as [ think) are not Poets enough to frighten on from
such excursions,
and who really do want a Iittle Art to shape them
(80).
Now, compare that statement to sorne of the affirmations Guerrero makes
in his note on the translation:
Personally,
1 have
never been at ease with any of the existing
translations
ofthe Noli. [...] When essayed by Filipinos, they suffer
from an, it seems to me, exaggerated
reverence lar
the original
text which
makes
for tortured
constructions.
[...] Rizal's
style is
ofien unlikely to appeal to the modem ear; Spanish,
moreover,
is a
language
that can afford to be more florid and sentimental
than
modem English./
have therefore allowed myself thefurther
liberty
01certain passages
that might
have otherwise
have provoked
a
sophisticated
snigger.
[...] Other passages
had lo be re-worked
willy-niliy
(Rizal, Cancer xvi-xvii,
[my emphasis]).
Leaving aside the pseudo-linguistic
cornrnentaries on the genius of the
different languages, this piece poses many methodological
as well as
theoretical problems. Besides the obvious implications for the on-going
debate over foreignizing versus domesticating
approaches to translation,
we find the problem ofthe translation ofthe canon. Rizal is a canonical
author in the Philippines, as Guerrero himselfrecognises,
and, therefore,
any approach to his work is condemned to be polemical. Guerrero's does
not escape this fate, but 1 find his vision to be especially problematic

Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada
because under all his rhetoric I cannot find a liberating project, that is, an
attempt to question the canon, but rather a very compromising
one, an
ideology that erases difference, that relegates Rizal to the role of ghost.
This move, typical
of the colonial
translation,
is now found
in a
postcolonial
text. Is Guerrero
crossing
the boundaries
that separate
coloniser from colonised or is he the victim of sorne kind of Althusserian
interpellation, having intemalised the discourse ofthe coloniser?
Every single translation is shaped by an outside presence, dif-
ferent from that ofthe author, and can be read as a map, an outline ofthe
presence ofthe translator. I would like to follow a couple ofpaths
in the
maps provided by the translations
I am studying, because they are re-
lated to language and, moreover, because Guerrero himself talks about
them in his introductory note. Both are puns that can, and many times do,
drive a translator crazy, since they are based on sounds and words ofthe
source language that are difficult to reproduce in the target language.
The first case is set in a discussion between doña Consolación
and her Spanish husband over the correct way to pronounce the name of
the country, "Filipinas'".
Consolación
is a native woman who tries to
forget her Tagalog and to use as much Spanish as possible in order to
appear as a true European; the problem is that she actually is a Philippine,
and cannot completely erase the Tagalog in her, which re-appears in her
phonetics, much to her concern". When speaking Spanish, she pronounces
"Pilipinas"
instead of "Filipinas",
and her husband, a Spanish officer,
corrects her. When he tries to explain why she has to say "Filipinas",
he
also gets into trouble, since he says that the country was named after
king Felipe V (sic) and had the Latin suffix -nas, meaning "island of
Indians", added after it (sic). Therefore,
she concludes,
the country's
name must me "Felipenas".
The discussion
goes on and the husband
eventually seeks advice from a fellow officer, who tells him that the an-
cient pronunciation
was "Filipi" (hence Filipinas), but that all modem
people in Madrid have switched to a "French" fashion and the name is to
be pronounced "Felipe."
In this instance, Rizal is being very careful to expose several
political problems without actually stating them overtly: the situation of
the colonial subject, eager to leam the coloniser's language and, therefore,
losing her identity and her own language in the process; the situation of

without necessarily having any culture, even with a distrust of any modem

ideas, a typical attitude ofthe

putting words in italics, and Guerrero makes an adaptation
to English
phonetics, switching the problem from the pronunciation
ofvowels
(i-e)
to the pronunciation of consonants (f-p). What is really interesting, though,
is that Guerrero makes sorne ideological adaptations as well, a move that
can only be read as colonial.
First, the meaning
of the so-called
Latin suffix ("island
of
Indians") changes in Guerrero's
into being "nigger islands". Secondly,
the discussion
of the French intluence
on Madrid's
linguistic fashion
tums into the intluence of"the British or Oxford accent"; does that mean
that upper Spanish cIasses were receiving an Oxbridge education at the
time?
The
racial
switch
is difficult
enough
to explain,
but the
anglosaxonisation
ofthe Spanish language is quite impossible. Or maybe
not. It seems to be the result of the particular history of the Philippines,
firstly colonised by Spain and, later, by the United States. In Rizal's time,
for any Filipino (i.e. Spaniard bom in the Philippines),
the other was
definitely the Philippine native, the "Indian", and the prestige centre, the
capital of the metropolis,
Madrid,
even if under a suspicious
French
intluence.
By the time Guerrero
is writing, we find a new other, the
"nigger", and a new prestige centre, England. This move implies a quite
complicated
ideological
swift, since North-American
intluence makes
prestige travel further north in Europe but Spanish colonisation
cannot
be completely erased; thus, we end up with Spaniards speaking with an
Oxbridge accent!
The second case is the idiolect of doña Victorina'", the doctor
De Espadaña's wife, again a native woman married to a poorly educated
Spaniard. Rizal repeats his criticism showing a character that tries to fit
into a role imposed by colonial society: "doña Agustina, aunque hablaba
mal el español, era más española que la Agustina de Zaragoza"!'.
The
irony is actually accentuated
since the dialog where she shows such
Iinguistic innovation takes place right after sorne comments made by a
Chinese candlemaker,
who actually uses a Chinese pidgin ... at least in
the Spanish version.

Besides the difficulties of reproducing in English the Andalusian
Spanish accent, there are a couple of proverbs (misquoted)
and, more
importantly, there is native language, the real ghost of the novel, since it
appears and disappears from the original and has real difficulties when
travelling into the translations. Derbyshire chooses a quite literal version
ofthe proverbs and tries to reproduce the accent in English:
'El que a buena zambra ze acobija, buen palo ze le arrima "(Rizal,
Noli 457) (ef
el que a buen árbol se arrima,
buena
sombra
le
cobija).
'
'He who zhelterz himzelf well, builds a good roof'(Rizal,
Caneer
461) (ef keep good men company and you shall be ofthe number).
This strategy, coherent with his quite literal approach
to the
source language, is abandoned when it comes to translating
the Chinese
pidgin, which is reproduced in Standard English and gets an explanatory
footnote. Guerrero's move, on the other side, is quite different. He chooses
to transform all quotes into English, making phonetic adaptations,
and
doña Victorina's accent is "transferred to American 'Old South'" (Rizal,
Eden xii); a transformation
that transports the reader outside the actual
coordinates
of the novel, and can on1y be understood
by taking into
account
contemporary
Philippine
history;
otherwise,
why would
a
Philippine native speak with a North-American
accent?:
'If you-all are takin'
sheltah under a biggah tree, you are gettin'
a
biggah beatin'.'
(Rizal, Eden 377)
As 1 have said, native languages
are the actual ghosts of the
novel, since they travel all over the text and into the translations.
First,
there is the question ofRizal writing in Spanish, a language he mastered,
but which was not his mother tongue. Secondly, the use or misuse of
Tagalog by sorne ofthe
characters,
either because that is the language
they speak or the language they want to forget. Third, and even more
important, is the way this linguistic complexity is managed in the trans-
lations. We have seen sorne examples from Derbyshire's
translations,
the way in which he keeps the quotes the way they were in the original,
except for the Spanish puns, which are reproduced, with better or worse
effect, in English. The edition includes a glossary at the end, not present
in the original, an indicator of the change in the potential reader of the

way in which he keeps the quotes the way they were in the original,
except for the Spanish puns, which are reproduced,
with better or worse
effect, in English. The edition ineludes a glossary at the end, not present
in the original, an indicator of the change in the potential reader of the
Noli me tangere: Filipinos and Tagalog speakers did not need that kind
of linguistic help at the time, since they were familiar with the sociolin-
guistics ofthe
country, a familiarity that the US occupation
helped de-
stroy. Guerrero's
translation, however, completely erases the native lan-
guages, making them a presence that can only be guessed but is never
actually there. English is meant for everybody
and Tagalog terms are
replaced by functional or descriptive equivalents, explanations
that hide
(deculturalise)
cultural terms. In this sen se, the colonial translation, Der-
byshire's, is eloser to the original than the postcolonial, Guerrero 's, which
makes the Chinese candlemaker
forget his pidgin and learn how to speak
E glish with an accent:
Donbee c1azy; Bilgen Anipolo

Conclusion:
When Translation
Encounters
Politics
The study of different versions of a text can prove revealing of
the ideological
changes
concerning
a given subject.
This connection
between ideology and language is even more powerfully revealed when
the translation being examined comes frorn postcolonial contexts in which
language, power and ideology have shaped the way many cultures see
themselves
and are seen from outside. This study, however, has been
approached
from
quite
distinct
perspectives
that
seemed
to be
independent frorn each other; there was a look at cultural practices from
a political frame, or there was a linguistic study, which was seen as free
from ideological constraints.
Rizal 's novel and its translations into English help us understand
the lirnitations of these approaches,
mainly because they ask for new
theoretical tools in order to approach them. Traditional
criteria, such as
fidelity, which result in a valuation ofthe work ofthe translator, are not
very helpful, because they do not give any information
on the causes
that are beyond it, remaining
only on the level of the results. Textual
criticism that reads the translation
as a map, a tool suitable to find the
ideological ground upon which language is constructed,
also calls for a

Tofiño-Quesada
redefinition
ofthe role ofthe editor. Ifthe different editions of a text are
treated as problematic,
the way translations
are seen, and fitted into the
larger scope oflinguistic
mediation, many interesting conclusions can be
deduced, among them the idea that editorship
is not ideologically-free
and, therefore,
needs to be evaluated as closely as any translation
is.
It is impossible to recreate the past, but one can definitely shape
the present in order to build a different future. At a time when intemational
cultural exchanges are at stake, to show the contradictions
between stated
ideologies
and actual cultural productions,
between the activity of the
translator as a mediator and the image ofthe reader as an interpreter, can
be a very powerful tool in developing
a politics of resistance.
