The Discourse of Antifeminism
and the Collapse of the Narrator
in Arcipreste de Talavera

University af Natre Dame
This
paper
seeks
to define
and contextualize
antifeminism
in Arcipreste
de Talavera, situating
it at the
intersection
of medieval medical discourse
and scholastic
notions
of woman.
It also inquires
into the function
of
antifeminism,
and this in two ways: Why antifeminism?
How does it operate within the text?
In this regard we will
see how
the discourse
of antifeminism
reflects
the
inconsistencies
and paradoxes of the medieval reception of
patristic
teaching.
Finally, it considers how antiferninism
inflects
our reception
of the text,
which
is to say our
reception
of the
narrator,
for
here
we have
a text
=-Arcipreste
de Talavera-specifically
named
for the
narrator, and certainly,
as in all exemplary
discourse,
the
credibility and authority of the text is directly predicated on
Anclajes.

the credibility
and authority
of its narrator.
These
considerations
wi ll
ultimately
apply
to
the
most
controversial
part of the Arcipreste
de Talavera,
the
concluding epistle.
Central to the insidious antifeminism of both narrator
and text is the purposeful essentializing of woman.
While
Book TI initially proposes a theoretical distinction between
bad and good women ("Aquí comienca
la segunda parte
deste libro en que dize que se tractaría de los vicios, tachas e
malas condiciones
de las malas e viciosas
mugeres,
las
buenas
en sus virtudes
aprovando"),
in practice
the
distinction
is inmediately
blurred,
already
in the first
paragraph of Chaper 1:
Por quanto
las mugeres
que malas
son, viciosas
e
deshonestas
o enfamadas,
no puede ser dellas

que las mugeres comúnmente por la mayor parte
de avaricia son doctadas (121)1
and subsequently obliterated:

regla general

... por quanto toda muger, quando quier que vee otra de
sy más fermosa, de enbidia se quiere morir ... (136)
... que non es muger en el mundo por la mayor parte

e de se presciar de arreos e

000 (163)
La muger ser mucho parlera, regla general es dello;
que non es muger
que non quisyere
syenpre

e ser
escuchada ... (168)
In contrast
to this reductive
view of woman,
the
narrator emphasizes
the specificity of men: "E por quanto
comúnmente
los onbres non son reprehendidos
como las
mugeres so reglas generales--esto
por el seso mayor e más
juyzio
que alcancan-e-,
conviene; pues, particularmente
fablar
de cada uno segund
su qualidad ... " (179).
It is
precisely this overdetermination
of women that R. Howard
Bloch has defined as the essence of misogyny:
[A]ny
essentialist
definition
of woman
... is the
fundamental
definition
of misogyny
... [S]uch essentialist
definitions of gender are dangerous not only because they are
wrong or undifferentiated
but, once again, because historically
they have worked to eliminate the subject from history.'
Rather
than eliminate
woman
as subject;
the narrator
constructs
a generic woman whom he ventriloquizes
and
manipulates
as subject; together they comprise the central
comic duo of the Arcipreste de Talavera.
Medieval Misogyny and the Art;ipreste de tatavera
As Bloch has remarked,
one of the great facts of
Western cultural
amnesia
is that the Bible contains
two
stories of Creation.'
The first (Gene sis 1:7) relates: "And
God created
man in his image;
in the image of God he
161
Dayle Seidenspinner-Núñez
created him, masculine and ferninine he created them. "4 The
suppression of the story of the simultaneous creation of man
and woman is crucial
for the history
of sexuality
in the
West;
although
the "lost"
version
that
confirms
the
coetaneity and equality of the sexes comes before the more
sexist account of their difference, it is the second so-called
Yahwist account in Genesis 2:7 that was appropiated in the
patristic
and medieval
periods.
Based on this canonical
version
("And the Lord God built the rib which he took
from Adam into a woman:
and brought
her to Adam"),
woman,
conceived
as
secondary,
derivative,
and
supplemental,
assumes the burden of all that is inferior,
debased, scandalous,
and perverse.'
Man, forrned directIy
by God and sharing in his divinity, is associated with spirit
or soul while woman,
relegated
to the realm
of matter,
partakes of the body, fleshly incarnation being by definition
the sign of humanity's fallen condition (Bloch 1987: 25-27).
The patristic and scholastic articulation of gender assumes a
hierarchical
relationship
of male to female built upon the
analogy of the world of intelligence
(male) to that of the
senses
(female),
transforming
the Genesis
story into an
allegory of the soul in which man is rnind, intelligence, ratio
or rational
soul,
and woman
is sensus,
body,
animal
faculties, physical appetite.
Bloch's discussion of medieval misogyny provides a
fundamental part of the Foucauldian "grid of intelligibility"
to examine
the gallery
of female
exemplars
that parade
through Books 1 and 11 of Arcipreste
de Talavera.
Chief
among "los vicios, tachas e malas condiciones de las malas
e viciosas mugeres" listed in the second book are those that
reflect the gross materialism conventionally
assigned to the
female
condition.
Avariria
is, therefore,
the first vice
presented
in Chapter
1 ("De los vicios e tachas e malas
162
"iGuay del que duerme solo!": The Oiscourse
of Antifeminism
and the Collapse oL
condiciones de las perversas mugeres, e primero digo de las
avariciosas"); the examples given are the famous hyperbolic
laments for the lost egg (124) and the missing hen (125).
Codicia,
explored
in Chapter
3 ("De cómo las mugeres
aman a dyestro
e a syniestro
por la gran cobdicia
que
tyenen"), likewise manifests woman's materialismo
The writers
of the first centuries
of Christianity,
Bloch notes, were obsessed with the relation of women to
decoration.
In patristic and later medieval writing, woman
is a creature
who aboye
all else and by nature
covets
omamentation;
she is by her secondary nature associated
with artifice and decoration.
In Chaper 3 of Book II dealing
with woman's covetousness
(132-36), there are exhaustive
lists
detailing
her c1othes,
ointments,
cosmetics,
and
accessories
(133-34).
AH that is secondary, artificial,
and
thus assimilated to woman was considered in the thought of
the Church
Fathers
to participate
in a supervenient
and
extraneous
rival creation
that distracted
manis attention
away from God (Bloch
1991: 41).
This nexus
of ideas
suggests that the representation
of woman as omament was
an integral part of a broader paradigm that Bloch calls an
estheticizing
of femininity; the association of woman with
the cosmetic, the supervenient, and the decorative includes
not only the arts but the entire realm of simulation
and
representation,
deception and pretense:
Todas

This estheticizing of the feminine generates an entire range
of terms
associated
with
ostentation,
ornament,
and
simulacra:
thus,
in Arcipreste
de Talavera,
woman
is
accused
of sins of the imagination
such as vainglory
(Chapter 9), pride (Chapter 8), and envy (Chapter 4); her
inconstancy
and instability
(Chapter
5) and inscrutable
secrecy
(Chapter
6) emanate
from her accidental
and
derivative nature.
The Loveres' Maladye
of Hereos
There is more, nevertheless,
to the Arcipreste
de
Talavera than conventional vitriole against women.
Recent
critics have shown how eros was considered a disease in the
Middle
Ages, and Michael
Solomon
has examined
the
relation between antifeminism in Arcipreste de Talavera and
medieval medical pathology."
Throughout his treatise, the
Arcipreste de Talavera is preoccupied with the human body,
identifies sexuality as a disease, and reminds his readers that
erotic love destroys
their body and their soul.?
He cites
medical
warning s against sexual behavior" and dedicates
Book III to outlining the four types of body composition
(sanguino,
colórico,
flemático,
malencólico)
and their
respective "dispusyción para amar e ser amado."
In the lengthy scientific treatises that theorized
the
nature, cause, and cure of eros, the imagination was held to
164
"¡Guay del que duerme solo!": The Discourse of Antifeminisrnand the Collapse of..
play a crucial role in the psychosomatic
nature of sexual
conduct by generating erotic appetite or desire in the liver,"
Many of the amorous conventions
that we associate with
courtly love were essentially rhetorical strategems designed
to fulfill the erotic desire generated by the imagination.
For
example, Book I of Andreas Capellanus' De amore presents
a compendium
of dialogues that dramatize how rhetorical
invention can effectively overcome a woman's resistance to
a man's sexual advances."
The purpose of these rhetorical
exercises is therapeutic,
to persuade
the reluctant
woman
and thus
sate
male
erotic
desire.
When
desire
was
unfulfilled
or
thwarted,
lo ve became
pathological
(lovesickness),
a fixation that, if untreated,
could lead to
madness and even death.
An effective countertherapy for the cure of the initial
stages of eros was to distract the patient (medical treatises
counsel
hunting
or fishing,
playing
games,
traveling,
observing nature, or finding other women) or to remove the
ailing person from the source stimulating
his desire and
imagination.
Consequently,
in his introduction,
the
Arcipreste
counsels his readers to flee from the source of
their
disease:
"Fuyd
uso
continuo
e conversación
frequentada de onbre con muger, muger con onbre, fuyendo
de oyr palabras
ociosas,
desonestas
e feas de tal aucto
yncitatyvas
a mal
obrar,
quitada
toda
oci osydad,
conversación
de compañía
desonesta,
luxuriosa
e mal
fablante ..." (45).
His injunction tacitly acknowledges how
language incites desire.
In more
advanced
cases
of eros,
however,
the
imagination
must be freed from its obsession
with the
beloved by supplanting images of pleasure with images of
abjection and disease.
It is at this point that medical and
rhetorical theories regarding therapy for eros intersect with
165
Dayle Seidenspinner-Núñez
misogyny
and antifeminism,
for if a certain
type
of
discourse could corrupt the imagination by intensifying
the
desire
for the beloved,
then a contrary
discourse
could
counter the positive images and free the captive imagination
(Solomon, 5). Thus in Book III,
"The Rejection of Love,"
Andreas Capellanus reverses his rhetoric to vilify women:
Furthermore,
not only is every
woman
by nature
a
miser, but she is also envious and a slanderer of other women,
greedy, a slave to her belly, inconstant,
fickle in her speech,
disobedient
and impatient
of restraint, spotted with the sin of
pride and desirous of vainglory, a liar, a drunkard, a babbler, no
keeper
of secrets,
too much given to wantonness,
prone
lo
every evil, and never loving any man in her heart (201).1l
By abjectifying the beloved, the imagination's
fix could be
broken; Bemard of Gordon, for example, recornmends in his
medical
treatise
(1305)
that the lover
be told that the
beloved
is a drunkard,
that she urinates
in bed, that her
hands and feet are deformed, that she is dirty, epileptic, and
sti nky."
In the Arcipreste
de Talavera,
the narrator
implements a similar strategy to cure eros by collecting and
codifying anecdotes, descriptions,
arguments, and diatribes
against women in Book II.
Yet in perusing the chapter headings in Book 1 it is
clear the he combines
the discourse
of antifeminism
of
medieval medical science with that of scholastic moral and
religious
treatises.
By definition,
disease
is a social
construct
based
on culturally
determined
notions
of
normalcy.
The pathology
of love
traced
in Book
1
emphasizes
the lover's deviance from scholastic paradigms
of masculinity
where
man is associated
with
mind,
intelligence,
spirit, ratio or reason, essence,
and unity of
166
"[Guay del que duerme solo!": The Discourse
of Antiferninisrn
and the Collapse of..
being in contrast to the association
of woman with body,
appetite, matter, sensus, accident, and difference.
In Book 1,
love is depicted
as a madness that diseases
man's reason
(Chapter 1, "Cómo el que ama locamente desplase a Dios"),
estranges man from his maker (Chapter 2, "Cómo amando
muger agena ofende a Dios, a sy mesmo, e a su próximo"),
causes man to break the ten commandments
(Chapters 20-
29), indulge in the seven mortal sins (Chapters 30-36), and
forfeit his virtue (Chapter
37, "Cómo el que ama pierde
todas
las
virtudes"),
virtue
and
virility
being
both
etymologically and ontologically linked. In this way, falling
in love reenacts the original fall as man succumbs over and
over again to woman's wiles and verbal deception.
Woman,
Language,
and the Archmisogynist
of Talavera
In Book Il, the sins that the perversas
muge res are
most consistently
accused of are therefore
linguistic:
"De
cómo la muger es murmurante e detractadora"
(Chapter 2),
"De cómo la muger miente jurando e perjurando"
(Chapter
10), "De cómo la muger parlera
synpre
fabla de fechos
agenos" (Chapter
12).
Even when the narrator
addresses
other
sins, he often
dramatizes
these
by appropriating
woman's speech."
In Arcipreste
de Talavera -the pillaging
of direct
female
discourse
represents
woman
as abjection
and
disease.
In the famous lament for her lost egg, the narrator
ties woman's speech to madness and contagion:
"Iten, por
un huevo dará bozes como loca e fenchirá a todos los de su
casa
de ponceña"
(124).
For the loss of an egg,
the
narrator's
mimicry
reveals
how women
are capable
of
incessant ranting and raving.
This ploy not only reaffmns
167
Dayle Seidcnspinner-Núñez
the medieval
topos
of women's
speech
as excess
but
functions therapeutically to cure lovesickness: to cure aman
who has become ill and mad over the love of a woman, the
narrator portrays woman as a type of illness and form of
madness.
Excessive speech was medically diagnosed as a
disease-parlería-in
the late Middle Ages and medical
treatises
remitid us that the Spanish
adjective
loco is a
derivative
of the Latin locuaces and thus link excessive
speech to madness."
By representing
female
speech
as
disease
the narrator
effectively
undermines
the very
mechanism
that
allows
women
to counter-present
themselves
against antifeminist
representations
(Solomon,
6).
The association of woman with the abuse of language
is a constant theme in patristic
exegesis:
lacking Adarn's
intellectual fullness, Eve is easily persuaded by the serpent
to eat of the forbidden fruit; afterward, her deceptive words
lead Adam to betray God's cornmandment.
Eve's misuse of
language
is an ironic inversion
of Adam's earlier use of
language in naming the animals as a means of intellection.
Bloch extends the homology of woman and fallen language
and examines
related figures-woman
as riot, woman as
excess,
woman
as rhetoric
(17-22);
the topos
of the
garrulous
female
and its corrollary
woman
as liar and
deceiver were persistent features of medieval antifeminism
and the most salient feature of the Arcipreste's constructed
woman.
The deceptive
seductiveness,
ornamentation,
and
verbosity
associated
with woman
is for the medieval
Christian west virtually synonymous with the delusiveness
of language embodied in rhetoric.
While grarnmar and logic
constitute
within
the trivium
the sciences
of the true,
respectively
of rectitude
of expression
and of correct
168
"[Guay del que duerme solo!": The Discourse
of Antifeminism
and the Collapse of..
propositions,
the antifeminist
thinking of the High Middle
Ages assoeiates woman with rhetorie, the art of persuasion,
and figures her as the sophist, the dissimulator, the seducer
with false arguments; concomittantly
woman is associated
with poetics and figured as the liar, the deceiver, the creator
of fictions.
The reproach against women in the Arcipreste
de Talavera
is thus laden
with the varieties
of verbal
abuse-excessive
talkativeness,
argumentativeness,
the
spirit of eontradietion,
indiscretion,
lying, and seduetion
with words-that
characterize the.medieval reproach against
rhetorie-and
poetics-ior
being uncontrollable,
exeessive,
untruthful, appealing, and deeeptive to the senses.
Yet the Arcipreste
de Talavera
abounds
with
examples
of the garrulity
and ineonsisteney
of its own
Arcipreste-narrator
who speaks at such exeessive
length
about woman's loquacity and is as argumentative, contrary,
and irrational as the woman he ventriloquizes."
Throughout
Book I1, the narrator
indulges
in rhetorical
overkill
by
grossly exaggerating
the evil of woman and by inundating
his readers with repetitious and often irrelevant examples of
her maliee.
For example, Chapter 2 elaborates "De eómo la
muger es murmurante e detraetadora," but the narrator's own
mongering
of vicious and gossipy seandals
suggests
that
murmurar, detraer, and mal fablar
are not gender specific
behaviors.
Moreover,
having
bashed
and offended
womanhood at great length, he sanctimoniously concludes:
Estas y otras maneras de fablar tyenen las mugeres:
de las
otras murmurar,
detraer e mal fablar, e quexarse de sy mesmas, que
fazer otra cosa ynposyble
les sería.
Esto proviene
de uso malo e
luengarnente
continuado,
non conosciendo
su defallimiento;
que es
un pecado
muy terrible
la persona
non conoscer
a sy, nin a su
fallimiento.

Pues, por Dios, cada qual asy fable
de su próximo
que de
ofenderlo se abstenga (132, emphasis mine).
The theme of Chapter 6, "Cómo la muger es cara con
dos fazes,"
is the treacherous
duplicity
of women:
"La
muger ser de dos fazes e cuchillo de dos tajos, non ay dubda
en ello, por quanto de cada día veemos que uno dize por la
boca, otro tyene al coracón"
(146); "E con estas y otras
maneras
saben fazer sus fechos ellas, teniendo una en el
coracón
e otra en la obra o en la lengua"
(150).
The
following
chapter (150-55)
examines
"Cómo la muger es
desobediente."
As usual the narrator illustrates his theme
with a story. A wise man of Escocia discovers that his wife
has been unfaithful:
if he kills her, he will be prosecuted
and her powerful
family will tum against him; and if he
denounces her publicly, he will be dishonored.
He resolves
to have her kill herself: he poisons a cup of fine wine and
places it on a window admonishing her in front of the entire
household
not to taste it because she will die.
The wife
predictably disobeys him, drinks the wine, and dies:
Dio con ella a la boca e bevió un poco e luego cayó
muerta.
Desquel marido syntió las bozes, dixo: "¡Dentro yase
la matrona!".
Luego entró corriendo el marido mesándose
las
barvas, dixiendo a altas bozes: "¡Ha, mesquino de mí!".
Pero
baxo dezía:
"¡Qué tan tarde lo comencé!".
En altas boses
dezía: "¡Captivo!
¿Qué será de mí?".
En su coracón
dezía:
"¡Sy non muere esta traydora!".
Yva a ella e tirava
della,
pensando que se levantaría, pero ally acabó sus días (152).
Most of the amplificatio
(the same story is only a
few lines
long in Andreas
Capellanus)
elaborates
the
ingenuity
of the husband; yet to say one thing with one's

mouth ("En altas boses dezía") and another with one's heart
("En su coracón
dezía") was defined
in Chapter
6 as the
treacherous duplicity of women ("que uno dize por la boca,
otro tyene al coracón") and is now admired in Chapter 7 as
the clever ingenuity of mano
This
blatant
double
standard
undermines
the
pretensions of exemplarity of the narrator who now embarks
on his second tale (152-53), a variation of the first in which
the betrayed husband arms a coffer with a crossbow, forbids
his wife to open it, and she dies: "Pues, vedes aquí en cómo
la muger morir o rebentar o fazer lo contrario de lo que le es
vedado."
The third exemplum
(153-54),
however,
is no
longer about disobedience
but rather about argumentative
and stubborn women ("Otra muger era muy porfiosa e con
sus porfías non dava vida a su marido").
Aman
orders his
wife to prepare a meal for him and his guests next to the
river: "E la muger asy lo fizo: puso la mesa luego e aparejó
byen de cena, e asentáronse
a cenar."
When serving the
meal, the husband demands to borrow the knife she wears at
her waist; she replies (with probable accuracy because he is
clearly
baiting
her) that it is not a knife
but a pair of
scissors.
He becomes
incensed
at her stubbornness
and
kicks her into the river. The narrator perversely focuses on
the tenacity of the drowning wife:
E luego comencé
a cabullirse
so el agua, e vínosele
[en] miente que non dexaría su porfía aunque fuese afogada:
¡muerta
sy, mas non vencida!
Comencé
a alear los dedos
fuera del agua, meneándolos
a manera
de tyseras,
dando a
entender
que aún eran tiseras, e fuese el río abaxo afogando
(154).
The fourth
tale relates
a similar
disagreement
171
Dayle Seidenspinner-Núñez
between
a husband
and wife (154-55)_
The tenous link
between theme (disobedience)
and exempla suggests that
the narrator is at least as interested in telling a good tale as
in moralizing, despite his concluding disclaimer:
Destos enxienplos
mill millares
se podrían
escrevir,
pero de cada día contescen tantas destas porfías quel escrevir
es por demás.
Concluye,
pues, que ser la muger porfiada
e
desobediente,
e querer
lo contrario
syenpre
fazer
e dezir,
prática lo demuestra.
Now the narrator
is as much
a character
in the
Arcipreste
de Talavera as the generic woman he vituperates.
From
these
examples,
he emerges
as an inconsistent,
duplicitous
narrator
given
to verbal
excess,
rhetorical
overkill,
and comic
exaggeration.
He is, however,
a
consummate
creator of fictions and his fictions
generate
more fictions, often, as we have seen with tales three and
four aboye, tangential
fictions.
Both his excess and his
exaggeration
serve
as a comic
indictment
of his own
antifeminist discourse.
And thus the book, the A rr;ipres te de
Talavera,
becomes
all it claims to reject:
inconsistency,
contradiction, deceit, excess, seductive language, a source of
mischief and mistrust.
Indeed, the narrator seeks to do to
his reader
precisely
what he projects
upon women:
to
manipulate
with words, to provoke
contradiction,
and to
seduce with what is defined as the essence of the feminine,
the ruses of rhetoric.
This calls into question
the credibility
of his two
central characters: the fiction he constructs of himself as a
reliable narrator and the fiction he constructs of woman as
an object
of vituperation.
Ultimately
the reader's
own
strategy can only be one of mistrust of both the narrator and
172
"¡Guay del que duerme solo!": The Discourse
of Antifeminism
and the Collapse of...
the text, which brings
us to the problem
of reading
the
Arcipre
ste
de Talavera.
The
final
wrinkle
in the
antifeminist
performative
is presented
in the conc1uding
epistle (280-81) where the narrator thematizes the reception
of his text and offers us the spectacle of what can only be
called the complete nervous breakdown of our authoritative
narrator."
The narrator
initially
laments
that because
of his
book he has fallen
into disfavor
among women
and he
ponders
whether
he should
make peace
with them by
buming his text. He falls asleep and in his dream more than
a thousand
beautiful
ladies
assault
him "a manera
de
martirio" in penance for his sins.
He awakens disoriented
and in pain,
lamenting
his loneliness
(" iGuay del que
duerme solo!"). The cocky, overblown authoritative speaker
who allegedly
had such a handle
on truth that he could
recount
"mil millares
destos
enxienplos"
can no longer
distinguish
"si era verdad
o sueño
o vanidad."
He
pathetically
appeals
to his readers
to advise
him;
our
overbearing
teacher
who
throughout
Books

bombarded us with his advice now asks for ours:
Por ende, hermanos, de dos uno demando, o paz haya
e perdón final, bienquerencia
de aquellas so qual mano viví en
esta vida, o que queme (quede?) el libro que yo he acabado e
no perezca.
Mas, con arrepentimiento
demando perdón dellas,
e me lo otorguen o que quede el libro y yo sea malquisto para
mientra viva de tanta linda dama o que pena cruel sea (281).
And the wavering archmisogynist narrator ultimately
collapses into the crazy, lonely old man imaged in the final
rhyme:
173
Day1e Seidenspinner-Nüñez
Pero iquay del cuytado
que siempre solo duerme
con dolor de axaqueca
e en su casa rueca
nunca entra en todo el año!
Este es el peor daño.
DEO GRATIAS.
This
breakdown
of the histrionic
Arcipreste
de
Talavera culminates the ongoing process of de-authorization
of the moralist narrator in the body of the text through self-
contradiction,
hypocrisy, and contamination.
Moreover,
it
subverts whatever therapeutic function antiferninism
rnight
have as a cure for pathological
eros.
If the maldezir
de
mugeres is designed to free the imagination from its fixation
and restore reason, order, virtud, and physical well being,
the fantasy,
disorientation,
and irrationality
of our
exemplary narratorat
the conclusion of his treatise suggest
that rnisogyny can lead to the same locura as erotic love.

5 While Adam's nature is essential and he participates
in what is
imaged to be an original unity of being, Eve-by-
product of a part of
the essential
(his rib)-is
accidental,
the offshoot
of division
and
difference;
this distinction
between
tbe genders
wbereby
man is
conceived
as unity
and woman
as difference
is central
to the
antifeminism
of medieval
Europe.
Patristic
notions
of woman
as
difference and accident are reinforced by scbolastic biological
theories
based
on Aristotle's
concept
of woman
as a "misbegotten
man," a
defective buman being resulting from an accident to the male sperrn.

maten el alma, éste
[i.e., el amor], enpero mata el cuerpo e condepna
el ánima por do el

primeramente

e aun el comer del todo; casy el oyr fallesce, que paréscele

Cfr. elsewhere in Book I how love causes death and suffering
(Chapter 14), the violation of the ten commandments
(Chapters 19-29),
cornmission of the seven mortal sins (Chapters 30-36), and forfeiture of
all virtues (Chapter 37).
8 See Book 1, Chapter
16, where citing Johannitius,
the Arabic
translator of Galen, the narrator wams that love and lust deprive man of
sleep which causes indigestion which debilitates the body (75).

appear
in the Arcipreste
de TaLavera; the
premise
that rhetoric
can create desire or undo desire is, of course,
Ovidian and underlies his Art o/ Love.

notes:
"These
units of discourse,
however,
are not
lirnited to anecdotes, descriptions,
and arguments against women, but
include
representations
of direct
female
speech
in which
women
176
"¡Guay del que duerme solo!": The Discourse
of Antifeminism
and the Collapse of...
belittle themselves.
Since Martínez presents these appropriations
not
as merely abjective descriptions
against women but abjective artifacts
from women they have an inmediacy wbicb in medical theory makes
them
extremely
powerful
as antidotes
for lovesickness"
(6).
He
examines
extracting
and storing the female voice as an example
of
pillaging, i.e., the excessive hoarding of goods and human resources by
the victor that prolonged tbe subjugation of the conquered and created
an economy in which tbe well being of the dominant was proportional
to the ill being of his victim.
14 Solomon notes that Francisco López Villalobos dedicates part of
his Traetado de Los tres grandes to tbe cause, symptoms, and cure for
the malady of parleria.
He discusses
the pathological
basis for the
disease
of excessive
speech
(corrupt
heart,
imbalance
of the
melancholic
humor) and notes: "Y por cuanto á la locura es cosa muy
propia de hablar mucho y nunca tener freno en la boca, por eso en esta
nuestra
lengua castellana
se le dió muy apropiado
nombre,
por que
locos y locuazos viene de locuaces, que en lengua latina quiere decir
parleros" (Sumario de Lamedicina: ALgunas obras [Madrid: Sociedad
de Bibliófilos, 1886],450).
15 Bloch conc1udes that prolixity and contradiction are characteristic
of rnisogynous literature (56).
16 The authenticity
of the conc1uding epistle has been questioned
because
it appears
in all the printed
editions
of the Arcipreste
de
Talavera but not in tbe manuscript.
Whether or not Martínez de Toledo
himself penned the epilogue, 1 would suggest that it carries to a logical
conclusion
the consequences
of the narrator's
self-contradiction
and
hypocrisy.
